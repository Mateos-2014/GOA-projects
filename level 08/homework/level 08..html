    <h1>MY FAVOURITE CAR</h1>
    <P>my favourite car is BMW M5. The BMW M5 is a high-performance variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand.
         It is considered an iconic vehicle in the sports sedan category.[1][2] The M5 has always been produced in the sedan (saloon)
          body style, but in some countries the M5 has also been available as a wagon (estate) from 1992 to 1995, from 2006 to 2010, 
          and since 2024.[3][4][5]

        The first M5 model was hand-built in 1985 on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest
         production sedan at the time.[6] M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1985.</P>
